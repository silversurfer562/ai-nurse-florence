"""
Compatibility shim for task imports used in tests.

In production `services.tasks` may be a package with task-specific submodules
for celery. For local development we keep a lightweight single-file module.
Some tests expect to patch `services.tasks.summarize_service` by importing
that dotted name; Python's import machinery requires that name to exist in
`sys.modules`. To support that without restructuring into a package, we
import the real service modules and register them under the package-style
name so `unittest.mock` patching works.

This file intentionally does not start any background workers or require
Redis â€” it's a safe shim for tests and local runs.
