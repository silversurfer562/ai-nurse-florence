# AI Nurse Florence Landing Page - Soft Launch Plan
**Target Date:** October 15, 2025

## Vision
Clean, professional landing page that showcases capabilities through **access to tools and data** rather than marketing copy. Let the work speak for itself to potential collaborators and decision makers.

- **Content over Marketing**: Show what we've built, not what we promise
- **Open Data Sharing**: Distribute valuable datasets to build community goodwill
- **Direct Access**: Link to live tools and resources immediately
- **Professional Credibility**: Demonstrate technical depth and healthcare expertise
