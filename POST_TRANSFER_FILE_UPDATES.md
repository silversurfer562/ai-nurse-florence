This document lists all files that contain references to the old repository location and need to be updated after the repository transfer to the Deep Study AI organization.

## Files Requiring Updates

### Critical Files (Update Immediately After Transfer)

#### 1. `.github/FUNDING.yml`
**Current**: 
```yaml
github: [silversurfer562]
```

**Update to**:
```yaml
github: [DeepStudyAI]
```
*Or update to organization sponsorship if configured differently*

#### 2. `deploy-railway-epic-demo.sh` (Line ~108)
**Current**:
```bash
echo "    - Repository: silversurfer562/ai-nurse-florence"
```

**Update to**:

```

### Documentation Files (Update as Part of Post-Transfer Cleanup)

```

  ```

```

**Options**:
- Remove after successful transfer
- Update to: "This repository is maintained by Deep Study AI, LLC"

### Search for Additional References

Run this command after transfer to find any remaining references:
```bash
grep -r "silversurfer562" . \
  --exclude-dir=.git \
  --exclude-dir=venv \
  --exclude-dir=node_modules \
  --exclude="*.pyc" \
  --exclude="*.log"
```

## Quick Update Script

After repository transfer, run this script to update the critical references:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update repository references after transfer
# Run from repository root

echo "🔄 Updating repository references to Deep Study AI organization..."

# Update FUNDING.yml
sed -i 's/github: \[silversurfer562\]/github: [DeepStudyAI]/g' .github/FUNDING.yml

# Update deploy-railway-epic-demo.sh
sed -i 's/silversurfer562\/ai-nurse-florence/DeepStudyAI\/ai-nurse-florence/g' deploy-railway-epic-demo.sh

# Update README.md - Remove transition notice
# This requires manual review - use your text editor

# Update CONTRIBUTING.md - Remove transition notice  
# This requires manual review - use your text editor

echo "✅ Automated updates complete"
echo "⚠️  Please manually review and update:"
echo "   - README.md (remove or update transition notice)"
echo "   - CONTRIBUTING.md (remove or update transition notice)"
echo ""
echo "After manual updates, commit changes:"
echo "   git add ."
echo "   git commit -m 'docs: update references after org transfer'"
echo "   git push origin main"
```

## Validation Checklist

After updating files, verify:

- [ ] `.github/FUNDING.yml` - GitHub Sponsors link updated
- [ ] `deploy-railway-epic-demo.sh` - Repository reference updated
- [ ] `README.md` - Transition notice removed or updated
- [ ] `README.md` - GitHub Sponsors link updated
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Transition notice removed or updated
- [ ] No remaining references to `silversurfer562` (run search command)
- [ ] All documentation links work correctly
- [ ] GitHub redirects working from old URLs

## Documentation Files to Keep

These files document the transition and should be **kept** in the repository:

- ✅ `TRANSFER_GUIDE.md` - Valuable reference for similar transitions
- ✅ `ORGANIZATIONAL_TRANSITION.md` - Documents project maturation
- ✅ `QUICK_TRANSFER_STEPS.md` - Quick reference guide
- ✅ `POST_TRANSFER_FILE_UPDATES.md` - This file
- ✅ `NOTICE.md` - Contains organizational transition section

These files serve as:
1. Historical documentation of the project's evolution
2. Transparency about organizational structure
3. Reference material for other projects undertaking similar transitions
4. Evidence of proper corporate governance

## Optional: Archive Transition Documents

If you want to clean up the root directory after transfer is complete and stable (e.g., 30 days post-transfer), you can optionally move transition-specific documents to an archive:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-10-transfer
git mv TRANSFER_GUIDE.md docs/archive/2025-10-transfer/
git mv ORGANIZATIONAL_TRANSITION.md docs/archive/2025-10-transfer/
git mv QUICK_TRANSFER_STEPS.md docs/archive/2025-10-transfer/
git mv POST_TRANSFER_FILE_UPDATES.md docs/archive/2025-10-transfer/

# Add a README in the archive
cat > docs/archive/2025-10-transfer/README.md << 'EOF'
# October 2025 Repository Transfer Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the transfer of the AI Nurse Florence repository from personal account (silversurfer562) to the Deep Study AI organization in October 2025.

All transfer was completed successfully with zero data loss and no service interruption.

- TRANSFER_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive transfer guide
- ORGANIZATIONAL_TRANSITION.md - Full transition plan
