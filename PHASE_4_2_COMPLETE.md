```

### 4. Drug Interactions Router (`src/routers/drug_interactions.py`)
✅ **6 comprehensive endpoints** - REST API for drug interaction checking

**Available Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/v1/drug-interactions/check            # Primary interaction checking
POST   /api/v1/drug-interactions/bulk-check       # Bulk medication analysis
POST   /api/v1/drug-interactions/search-drugs     # Drug database search
GET    /api/v1/drug-interactions/severity-levels  # Severity classification info
GET    /api/v1/drug-interactions/health           # Service health check
GET    /api/v1/drug-interactions/statistics       # Usage statistics
```
