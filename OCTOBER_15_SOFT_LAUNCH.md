- **Mitigation:** Already tested locally, builds successfully

- **Risk:** Railway deployment issues
- **Mitigation:** Follow CLAUDE.md deployment guidelines, deploy before 8 AM

- **Risk:** Authentication breaks
- **Mitigation:** Authenticated routes moved to /app, public routes separate

### Business Risks
- **Risk:** NIH rejects data license request
- **Mitigation:** Strong community service argument, live demo, public benefit focus

- **Risk:** No collaboration interest
- **Mitigation:** Focus on open data sharing, build community goodwill first

- **Risk:** Dataset preparation delays
- **Mitigation:** Launch without datasets, add them incrementally
