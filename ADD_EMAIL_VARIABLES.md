2. **Verify password** - Must be `whteggcxypqmpdvh` (no spaces)
3. **Check Railway logs** - Look for "Email notifications enabled"
4. **Gmail App Password** - Verify it's still valid at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

### Need New Gmail App Password?

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select: "Mail" app
3. Generate new password
4. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
5. Update `SMTP_PASSWORD` in Railway
