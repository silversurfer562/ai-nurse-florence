# Deployment In Progress ⏳

## Current Status

✅ **Railway CLI deployment triggered successfully**
⏳ **Building and deploying now** (3-5 minutes)

---

## What's Happening Now

### Step 1: Building Docker Image (2-3 min)
- Installing Python dependencies
- Installing Node.js and npm
- Building React frontend (`npm ci && npm run build`)
- Creating Docker image

### Step 2: Starting Container (30 sec)
- Running `/app/start-railway.sh`
- Creating database tables
- Seeding 34 diagnoses
- Starting Gunicorn server

### Step 3: Health Checks (30 sec)
- Railway tests `/api/v1/health` endpoint
- Verifies app is responding
- Switches traffic to new deployment

### Step 4: Activation (instant)
- New version goes live
- Old container shuts down

## How to Monitor

### In Railway Dashboard:

1. Click **"ai-nurse-florence"** service (bottom box)
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click the newest deployment (top of list)
4. Watch **"Build Logs"** tab for progress
5. Switch to **"Deploy Logs"** tab once build completes

### Expected Log Messages:

**Build Logs:**
```
Step 1/12: FROM python:3.11-slim
Step 2/12: WORKDIR /app
...
Step 11/12: Building frontend
✓ npm ci
✓ npm run build
Step 12/12: CMD ["/app/start-railway.sh"]
Build completed successfully
```

**Deploy Logs:**
```
Starting AI Nurse Florence on port 8080
✅ Database tables initialized
📚 Diagnosis library empty, seeding initial data...
✅ Diagnosis library seeded with 34 diagnoses
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080
✅ Deployment successful
```

## How to Test (After Deployment)

### Test 1: Check Version
```bash
curl -k https://ainurseflorence.com/api/v1/health | grep version
```
Should show: `"version":"2.3.0"`

### Test 2: Check Translations
```bash
curl -k https://ainurseflorence.com/locales/en/translation.json
```
Should return JSON with `"appName": "AI Nurse Florence"`

### Test 3: Check Diagnosis Search
```bash
curl -k "https://ainurseflorence.com/api/v1/content-settings/diagnosis/search?q=diabetes&limit=3"
```
Should return array with diagnosis data (or empty array `[]` if graceful)

### Test 4: Reload the Site
Open in browser: https://ainurseflorence.com
- Translation keys should show proper text
- Drug interaction page should show "AI Nurse Florence" not "common.appName"

## If Deployment Fails

### Check Build Logs for:
- ❌ `npm run build` failed - Frontend build error
- ❌ `pip install` failed - Python dependency error
- ❌ Permission denied - Docker permission issue

### Check Deploy Logs for:
- ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError` - Missing Python module
- ❌ `no such table` - Database initialization failed (our fix should prevent this)
- ❌ Port binding error - Port already in use

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **0:00** - Railway CLI upload complete ✅
- **0:30** - Docker build starts
- **2:00** - Frontend build in progress
- **3:00** - Docker image complete
- **3:30** - Container starting, running database init
- **4:00** - App healthy, traffic switching
- **4:30** - ✅ **LIVE ON v2.3.0!**

**Current time since deploy triggered: ~3-4 minutes**
**Expected completion: ~1-2 more minutes**

---

## Quick Check Command

Run this every 30 seconds to see when it's live:

```bash
# One-liner to check version
curl -s -k https://ainurseflorence.com/api/v1/health 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"version":"[^"]*"'
```

When you see `"version":"2.3.0"` - **IT'S LIVE!** 🎉
