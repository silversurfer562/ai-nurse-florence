# SBAR Wizard AI Enhancements - Complete

**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Feature**: AI-Powered SBAR Communication Wizard
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Production-Ready

## Overview

Enhanced the SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation) Communication Wizard with tasteful AI functionality that saves nurses time while helping them produce higher quality clinical documentation. The AI features are contextual, non-intrusive, and designed to enhance rather than replace clinical judgment.

## What is SBAR?

SBAR is a standardized communication framework used in healthcare for patient handoffs and critical communications:
- **S**ituation - Current patient situation and reason for communication
- **B**ackground - Relevant clinical background and history
- **A**ssessment - Current assessment findings and clinical status
- **R**ecommendation - Suggested actions and priority level

## AI Features Implemented

### 1. Text Enhancement (Purple Buttons)
**Location**: All major text fields across all 4 wizard steps
**Functionality**: Converts informal nursing notes to professional clinical language

**Fields Enhanced**:
- Situation Description (Step 1)
- Background/Medical History (Step 2)
- Physical Assessment Findings (Step 3)
- Clinical Concerns (Step 3)
- Immediate Actions Needed (Step 4)

**How it works**:
- Nurse writes quick informal notes (e.g., "pt has chest pain bad")
- Click "Enhance with AI" button
- AI converts to professional SBAR format with proper medical terminology
- Section-specific prompts ensure appropriate clinical language for each SBAR component

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/wizard/sbar-report/ai/enhance`

**Example**:
```
Input: "pt has chest pain bad, started 2 hrs ago, sweating a lot"
Output: "Patient presents with severe chest pain of 2-hour duration, accompanied by diaphoresis. Immediate assessment required for possible acute coronary syndrome."
```

### 2. Completeness Checker (REMOVED)
**Status**: Removed as redundant
**Reason**: Built-in form validation already highlights missing required fields when navigating between steps. The AI completeness checker was providing duplicate functionality.

### 3. Priority Suggestion (Orange Button)
**Location**: Assessment step (Step 3) only
**Functionality**: AI analyzes vital signs and assessment data to suggest appropriate priority level

**Priority Levels**:
- STAT (üö®) - Immediate life-threatening conditions
- URGENT (‚ö†Ô∏è) - Serious conditions requiring prompt attention
- ROUTINE (üìã) - Standard follow-up and monitoring

**How it works**:
- Reviews all entered data: vital signs, physical assessment, clinical concerns
- Analyzes for critical patterns (e.g., chest pain + abnormal vitals = STAT)
- Provides priority recommendation with clinical reasoning
- Nurse retains final decision on priority level

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/wizard/sbar-report/ai/suggest-priority`

**Example**:
```
Input Data:
- Vital Signs: BP 180/110, HR 120, Chest Pain 8/10
- Assessment: Diaphoresis, shortness of breath

AI Suggestion: STAT - Critical vital signs with cardiac symptoms suggest possible MI. Immediate physician notification required.
```

### 4. Medication Interaction Checker (Red Button)
**Location**: Current Medications field (Step 2)
**Functionality**: Parses medication names from free text and checks for dangerous drug interactions

**How it works**:
1. AI parses medication names from nurse's text entry
   - Example: "metformin 500mg BID, lisinopril 10mg daily" ‚Üí ["metformin", "lisinopril"]
2. Calls existing DrugInteractionService
3. Returns top 3 most important interactions
4. Flags major/critical interactions with warnings
5. Suggests using full drug interaction checker for complete analysis

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/wizard/sbar-report/ai/check-medications`

**Integration**: Leverages existing drug interaction checking infrastructure developed in Phase 4.2

**Example**:
```
Input: "warfarin 5mg daily, aspirin 81mg daily, ibuprofen 400mg PRN"

Output:
‚ö†Ô∏è DRUG INTERACTIONS DETECTED

Medications: warfarin, aspirin, ibuprofen
Total Interactions: 3
üö® WARNING: MAJOR INTERACTIONS FOUND

Top Interactions:
1. warfarin + aspirin
   Severity: major
   Increased bleeding risk due to additive anticoagulant effects

2. warfarin + ibuprofen
   Severity: major
   Ibuprofen may increase anticoagulant effect

3. aspirin + ibuprofen
   Severity: moderate
   May diminish cardiovascular protective effect of aspirin
```

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoints (sbar_report.py)

#### 1. Text Enhancement
```python
@router.post("/ai/enhance")
async def enhance_sbar_text(request: SBAREnhanceRequest)
```
- Section-specific prompts for each SBAR component
- Converts informal notes to professional clinical language
- Graceful error handling with fallback to original text

#### 2. Completeness Check (REMOVED)
- Removed due to redundancy with form validation

#### 3. Priority Suggestion
```python
@router.post("/ai/suggest-priority")
async def suggest_priority(sbar_data: Dict[str, Any])
```
- Analyzes vital signs, physical assessment, clinical concerns
- Returns priority level (STAT/URGENT/ROUTINE) with reasoning
- Educational banner on all responses

#### 4. Medication Interaction Check
```python
@router.post("/ai/check-medications")
async def check_medication_interactions(medication_text: Dict[str, str])
```
- Uses AI to parse medication names from free text
- Integrates with existing DrugInteractionService
- Returns top 3 interactions with severity levels
- Flags major/critical interactions

### Service Integration

**OpenAI Service**: Used for:
- Text enhancement across all SBAR sections
- Medication name parsing from free text
- Priority suggestion analysis

**Drug Interaction Service**: Existing service provides:
- Comprehensive drug interaction checking
- Severity classification (major, moderate, minor)
- Clinical recommendations
- Evidence-based interaction data

## Frontend Implementation

### UI/UX Design Principles

1. **Tasteful Integration**: AI features are contextual helpers, not primary workflow
2. **Color-Coded Buttons**:
   - Purple = Enhancement/Improvement
   - Orange = Advisory/Suggestion
   - Red = Safety/Warning
3. **Non-Intrusive**: Buttons placed next to relevant fields, not blocking content
4. **Clear Affordances**: Icon + text labels make purpose obvious
5. **Helpful Tips**: Contextual guidance below fields

### Button Implementation

**Purple "Enhance with AI" Buttons**:
```html
<button type="button" onclick="enhanceText('field_name', 'section')"
    class="px-3 py-1 text-xs bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-purple-700">
    <i class="fas fa-magic mr-1"></i>Enhance with AI
</button>
```

**Orange "Suggest Priority" Button** (Assessment step only):
```html
<button type="button" onclick="suggestPriority()"
    class="px-3 py-2 text-sm text-orange-700 bg-orange-50 rounded-lg hover:bg-orange-100">
    <i class="fas fa-lightbulb mr-1"></i>Suggest Priority
</button>
```

**Red "Check Interactions" Button** (Medications field):
```html
<button type="button" onclick="checkMedicationInteractions()"
    class="px-3 py-1 text-xs bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-red-700">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle mr-1"></i>Check Interactions
</button>
```

### JavaScript Functions

**Text Enhancement**:
```javascript
async function enhanceText(fieldName, section) {
    // Gets field value, calls API, updates field with enhanced text
    // Shows loading state, handles errors gracefully
}
```

**Priority Suggestion**:
```javascript
async function suggestPriority() {
    // Collects all SBAR data, calls API
    // Displays priority suggestion with reasoning in alert
}
```

**Medication Interaction Check**:
```javascript
async function checkMedicationInteractions() {
    // Gets medication text, calls API
    // Displays interaction results with severity warnings
    // Suggests full drug checker for complete report
}
```

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Template Literal Escaping
**Problem**: Escaped backticks and dollar signs in HTML file prevented JavaScript execution
**Solution**: Removed all escape characters from template literals
```python
# Fixed with Python script
content = content.replace('\\${', '${')
content = content.replace('\\`', '`')
```

### 2. Window Scope Issue
**Problem**: `sbarApp` not accessible to wizard methods
**Solution**: Changed from `let sbarApp` to `window.sbarApp`
```javascript
// Before
let sbarApp;
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    sbarApp = new SbarWizardPage();
});

// After
window.sbarApp = null;
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    window.sbarApp = new SbarWizardPage();
});
```

### 3. Complete Button Not Working
**Result of Fix #2**: Complete and Save Draft buttons now work properly
- Complete button generates SBAR report and shows modal
- Save Draft button saves to localStorage with toast notification
