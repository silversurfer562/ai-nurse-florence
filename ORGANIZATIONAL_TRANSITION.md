## Impact Assessment

### What Changes

1. **Repository URL**: From `silversurfer562/ai-nurse-florence` to `DeepStudyAI/ai-nurse-florence`
2. **GitHub Actions**: Secrets need to be reconfigured
3. **Webhooks**: External integrations need URL updates
4. **Documentation**: References to repository URLs updated

### What Stays the Same

1. **Project History**: All commits, issues, and PRs preserved
2. **Stars and Forks**: Social proof maintained
3. **Functionality**: No changes to application code or features
4. **License**: Remains unchanged
5. **Public Benefit Mission**: Continues as stated in NOTICE.md

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Service interruption during transfer | High | Perform transfer during low-usage period; have rollback plan |
| Loss of GitHub Actions secrets | Medium | Document all secrets before transfer; reconfigure immediately |
| Broken external integrations | Medium | Test all integrations after transfer; update webhooks promptly |
| Community confusion | Low | Clear communication via README notice and announcements |
| Deploy key issues | Medium | Regenerate deploy keys after transfer if needed |

## Technical Considerations

### GitHub Features Affected

1. **Repository Settings**
   - Branch protection rules (need review after transfer)
   - Collaborator permissions (migrated to org teams)
   - Deploy keys (may need regeneration)

2. **GitHub Actions**
   - Secrets (must be reconfigured)
   - Workflows (should continue working)
   - Runner configurations (verify after transfer)

3. **Integrations**
   - Railway deployment (needs reconnection)
   - Third-party webhooks (need URL updates)
   - API callbacks (verify OAuth apps)

### Deployment Pipeline Impact

**Current Setup**:
- Railway deployment from GitHub
- Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Health monitoring endpoints

**Post-Transfer Actions**:
1. Reconnect Railway to new organization repository
2. Verify GitHub Actions workflows trigger correctly
3. Test deployment pipeline end-to-end
4. Confirm health monitoring still functional

## Stakeholder Communication Plan

### Internal Stakeholders (Deep Study AI Team)

**Timing**: Before, during, and after transfer  
**Method**: Direct communication, project meetings  
**Content**: Technical details, timeline, action items

### External Contributors

**Timing**: Before transfer (notice already added to README)  
**Method**: GitHub README notice, repository announcements  
**Content**: What's changing, why, what they need to do

### Users and Healthcare Professionals

**Timing**: Before and after transfer  
**Method**: README notice, documentation updates  
**Content**: Reassurance about continuity, new organizational backing
