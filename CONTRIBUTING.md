#### Code Standards

All contributors must follow our established development standards:

- **Development Philosophy**: Read [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md) for core principles
- **Coding Standards**: Follow [CODING_STANDARDS.md](./docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md) for Python, FastAPI, and healthcare-specific standards

- **Documentation Policy**: Follow [DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md) for writing clear, audience-focused docs
- **Architectural Decisions**: Review [ADRs](./docs/adr/) to understand key technical choices
- **Medical Accuracy**: Ensure all medical information is accurate and properly sourced

#### Documentation Standards

> **This book uses plain language and role-based navigation. New readers get simple explanations of purpose and reasoning; practitioners find just-in-time how-tos and reference; deep dives live in explanations. This structure keeps learning efficient and filters out unrelated detail.**

When contributing documentation:
- **Identify the category**: Is this a tutorial, how-to, reference, or explanation?
- **State your audience**: First paragraph must say who this is for
- **Use plain language**: Define technical terms, explain the "why"
- **Include examples**: Show working code from the actual codebase
- **Add signposts**: "If you're new, start here. If experienced, skip to..."

See [DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md) for complete guidelines and templates.

#### Pull Request Guidelines
