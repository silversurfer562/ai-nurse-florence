Since direct API access to comprehensive symptom data is limited, here's the best approach:

1. **Update Disease Service** to include MedlinePlus links:
   - When disease is looked up, generate MedlinePlus search URL
   - Add to external_resources in response
   - Example: https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html

2. **Improve UI Messaging** (remove negative language):
   Instead of: "‚ùå Detailed symptom information is not available in the database"

   Use: "üìö Comprehensive clinical information available:
          ‚Üí MedlinePlus: [link] (patient-friendly symptom information)
          ‚Üí PubMed: [link] (research articles and clinical studies)
          ‚Üí MONDO: [link] (disease ontology and classification)"

3. **Add Quick Symptom Guide** (curated common symptoms):
   - For top 50-100 common diseases, add curated symptom lists
   - Store in database as part of disease_reference
   - Source from reliable medical textbooks/guidelines

4. **Future Enhancement**:
   - Integrate with clinical knowledge bases (UpToDate API if available)
   - Use LLM to extract symptoms from PubMed abstracts
   - Build symptom database from medical literature

This gives nurses immediate access to symptom information while being honest about
data limitations.
