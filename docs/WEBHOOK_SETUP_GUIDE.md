## üè• Health Check System

### Automatic Health Checks

After a successful deployment, the system automatically tests:

1. **Core Health** (`/api/v1/health`)
   - Timeout: 10s
   - Expected: 200 OK

2. **Disease Lookup** (`/api/v1/disease/lookup?q=diabetes`)
   - Timeout: 15s
   - Tests MedlinePlus integration

3. **Gene Search** (`/api/v1/genes/search?q=BRCA1`)
   - Timeout: 15s
   - Tests myGene.info integration

4. **API Documentation** (`/docs`)
   - Timeout: 10s
   - Verifies Swagger UI accessibility

5. **Literature Search** (`/api/v1/literature/search?q=nursing`)
   - Timeout: 20s
   - Tests PubMed integration

### Health Check Report

Example report structure:
```json
{
  "deployment_id": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T12:05:00",
  "overall_status": "healthy",
  "checks_passed": 5,
  "checks_failed": 0,

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

1. **Check Gmail App Password**:
   - Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
   - App Password is 16 characters without spaces

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   railway variables
   # Should show:
   # SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   # SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
   # NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   # Look for:
   # "üìß Sending email notifications..."
   # "‚úÖ Email notification sent..."
   ```

4. **Less Secure Apps** (if using old Gmail setup):
   - Gmail may block "less secure apps"
   - Use App Passwords instead

### Discord/Slack Not Receiving

1. **Verify Webhook URL**:
   - Test manually with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST $DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "Test message"}'
   ```

2. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure webhook has permission to post in channel

### Health Checks Failing

1. **Check Deployment URL**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure DEPLOYMENT_URL is set correctly
   echo $DEPLOYMENT_URL
   # Should be: https://your-app.railway.app
   ```

2. **Manual Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/health
   ```

3. **Review Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   # Look for health check results
   ```

---

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Multiple Recipients**: Add multiple email addresses for team notifications
   ```bash
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=dev@company.com,ops@company.com,manager@company.com
   ```

2. **Separate Channels**: Use different Discord/Slack channels for:
   - Production deployments
   - Staging deployments
   - Development deployments

3. **Monitor Health Checks**: Review health check reports to catch degraded performance early

4. **Webhook Security**: Railway webhooks include signature headers for verification (optional)

5. **Event Retention**: Webhook events are stored in memory - consider logging to external service for long-term tracking
