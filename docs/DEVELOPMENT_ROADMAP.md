# Updated Tier 1 records:
{
  "icd10_code": "E11.9",
  "snomed_code": "44054006",           # NEW
  "diagnosis_display": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
  "fhir_codeable_concept": {           # NEW
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm",
        "code": "E11.9",
        "display": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications"
      },
      {
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "44054006",
        "display": "Diabetes mellitus type 2"

**Timeline:** 1 week

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Parse `icd10cm-order-2025.txt` for chapter/category structure
- [ ] Add `parent_code` field to `disease_reference` table
- [ ] Build hierarchical navigation tree
- [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation in UI: "Diseases > Endocrine > Diabetes > Type 1"
- [ ] Add "Show related codes" feature
- [ ] Enable category browsing (not just search)

**Deliverables:**
```python
# Database schema update:
class DiseaseReference(Base):
    parent_code = Column(String(50), ForeignKey("disease_reference.mondo_id"))
    children = relationship("DiseaseReference")

# API endpoints:
GET /api/v1/disease-reference/hierarchy/{code}
GET /api/v1/disease-reference/category/{category}/browse
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All diseases linked to parent categories
- Breadcrumb navigation works in UI
- Can browse by category (not just search)
- "Related codes" shows siblings and children

---

#### 5. **Add Billable Code Flags** [IMPORTANT]
**Problem:** Some ICD-10 codes (3-4 characters) are non-billable. Users need to know which require more specificity.

**Timeline:** 3 days

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research billable code rules (CMS guidelines)
- [ ] Add `is_billable` boolean field to database
- [ ] Flag non-billable codes (typically 3-character codes)
- [ ] Add warning in UI: "This code requires additional specificity for billing"
- [ ] Suggest billable child codes if available

**Deliverables:**
```python
class DiseaseReference(Base):
    is_billable = Column(Boolean, default=True)  # NEW

# API response:
{
  "icd10_code": "E11",
  "disease_name": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
  "is_billable": false,
  "warning": "This code requires additional specificity for billing",
  "billable_alternatives": ["E11.9", "E11.65", "E11.21"]
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Billable status accurately reflects CMS guidelines
- UI shows warning for non-billable codes
- Suggests specific billable alternatives

---

#### 6. **Patient-Friendly Descriptions** [IMPORTANT]
**Problem:** CDC descriptions are technical. Patients may not understand terms like "hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma."

**Timeline:** Ongoing (start with top 100 diagnoses)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `patient_friendly_description` field
- [ ] Write simplified descriptions for top 100 Tier 1 diagnoses
- [ ] Integrate MedlinePlus API for automated content
- [ ] Add reading level assessment (Flesch-Kincaid)
- [ ] Toggle between technical and patient-friendly views
- [ ] Medical review of simplified content

**Deliverables:**
```python
class DiagnosisContentMap(Base):
    technical_description = Column(Text)  # CDC original
    patient_friendly_description = Column(Text)  # NEW - Grade 6-8 reading level
    reading_level = Column(String(20))  # NEW - "Grade 6", "Grade 12", etc.

# Example:
{
  "technical_description": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperosmolarity without nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma",
  "patient_friendly_description": "Type 2 diabetes with very high blood sugar but without severe complications. Your blood may be thicker than normal.",
  "reading_level": "Grade 6"
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Top 100 diagnoses have patient-friendly descriptions
- Reading level ≤ Grade 8
- Medical accuracy validated
- UI toggles between technical and patient views

---

#### 7. **MedlinePlus API Integration** [IMPORTANT]

```python
# API integration:
def fetch_medlineplus_content(icd10_code):
    url = "https://connect.medlineplus.gov/service"
    params = {
        "mainSearchCriteria.v.c": icd10_code,
        "mainSearchCriteria.v.cs": "2.16.840.1.113883.6.90",
        "informationRecipient.languageCode.c": "en"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return parse_medlineplus_xml(response.content)

# Database cache:
class MedlinePlusContent(Base):
    icd10_code = Column(String(10), primary_key=True)
    content_summary = Column(Text)
    external_url = Column(String(500))
    language = Column(String(10))
    cached_at = Column(DateTime)
```
