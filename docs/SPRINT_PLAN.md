## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **UMLS account delayed** | Low | Medium | Manual SNOMED entry for 34 codes (3 hours) | Dev |
| **PostgreSQL migration issues** | Low | Low | SQLite works for launch, migrate post-launch | Dev |
| **Epic sandbox unavailable** | Medium | Low | Use public FHIR validator, certify post-launch | Dev |
| **Load testing reveals bottleneck** | Medium | Medium | Optimize or defer PostgreSQL migration | Dev |
| **Security vulnerability found** | Low | High | Fix before launch (blocker) | Dev |
| **Scope creep** | Medium | High | Stick to v1.0 scope, defer to v1.1 | PM |

---

## Out of Scope for v1.0

**Defer to v1.1+ (Post-launch):**
- Expand to 500 Tier 1 diagnoses
- AI-powered document review
- Mobile apps
- Additional languages beyond EN/ES
- Specialty editions
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration features

**Why:** Focus on core v1.0 launch. Add features based on user feedback.

---

## Communication Plan

**Weekly:** Update stakeholders on progress
**Daily:** Git commits with clear messages
**Launch:** Announcement email + demo session

---

## Rollback Plan

**If critical issue found on launch day:**

1. **Immediate:** Take production offline
2. **Assess:** Severity and fix time estimate
3. **Decide:**
   - Fix < 2 hours → Patch and redeploy
   - Fix > 2 hours → Rollback to previous version
4. **Communicate:** Update users on status
5. **Post-mortem:** Document what happened

**Rollback procedure:**
1. Restore database backup
2. Deploy previous code version
3. Clear caches
4. Smoke test
5. Bring production back online

---

## Celebration Plan 🎉

**When we launch Oct 28:**

1. Take screenshots of production launch
2. Record metrics (response time, database size, etc.)
3. Write launch announcement
4. Share with stakeholders
5. Plan v1.1 features based on feedback

**Then:**
- Take a day off! 😊
- Collect user feedback
- Start planning Phase 2

## Next Steps (Tomorrow - Oct 2)

**Morning:**
1. ☕ Coffee
2. 📝 Sign up for UMLS account (5 min)
3. 💻 Start SNOMED mapping script (2-3 hours)

**Afternoon:**
4. 🗄️ Enrich 34 diagnoses with SNOMED (30 min)
5. 🏷️ Add billable code flags (2 hours)
6. ✅ Commit progress
7. 📊 Update sprint plan

**By EOD Oct 2:**
