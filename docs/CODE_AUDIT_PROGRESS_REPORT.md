## Risks and Blockers

### Current Risks:
1. **Scope Creep:** Codebase is large (~28 services, ~50 components)
   - *Mitigation:* Prioritized approach, focus on core services first

2. **Time Estimation:** Full audit may take 40-60 hours
   - *Mitigation:* Phased approach, incremental value delivery

3. **Consistency:** Documentation style may drift over time
   - *Mitigation:* Self-improvement checklists, automated checks

### No Current Blockers
- All tools and access available
- No dependencies on external systems
- User supportive and patient ("take your time, plan, execute, document, iterate")

---

## Success Criteria

### Sprint 1 Success (Current):
- [ ] 50% of services documented to enterprise standards (14/28 services)
- [ ] All core medical services documented (5 services)
- [ ] Base classes and utilities documented
- [ ] Naming convention audit completed

### Overall Success (End of Phase 1-2):
- [ ] 80% documentation coverage across codebase
- [ ] 100% type hints for Python backend
- [ ] All public APIs documented with examples
- [ ] Automated quality gates in place
- [ ] Developer onboarding time reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days

## Conclusion

Solid progress has been made on the code audit and enterprise readiness initiative. The foundation is strong with comprehensive planning documents and 3 critical services fully documented to enterprise standards.

The systematic approach ensures quality while the phased plan prevents burnout and scope creep. The autonomous development patterns will enable the codebase to improve itself over time, aligning with the user's vision of "mutual increase through empowerment."

**Recommendation:** Continue with Priority 1 services (drug database, pubmed, evidence) to complete core medical services documentation, then proceed with base classes before moving to routers and utils.
