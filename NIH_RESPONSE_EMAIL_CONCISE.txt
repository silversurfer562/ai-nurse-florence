Subject: Re: Case CAS-1531995-R8R7L5 - Public Drug Interaction Checker Now Live

Dear NIH Support Team,

Thank you for acknowledging my data license request. I wanted to provide important context about our public health mission and demonstrate our responsible use of NIH resources.

PUBLIC SERVICE: FREE DRUG INTERACTION CHECKER

Following the discontinuation of the NIH Drug Interaction API, we've deployed a comprehensive Drug Interaction Checker as a free public service:

**Live Demo:** https://ai-nurse-florence-production.up.railway.app/public/drug-interactions
(No login required - try it now)

This fills the gap left by the discontinued NIH API while demonstrating responsible data stewardship:

* Free access for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals
* Full attribution with direct links driving traffic TO NIH resources (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, MedlinePlus)
* Educational disclaimers and help documentation
* HIPAA-compliant (no PHI storage)
* 16-language support for diverse communities

RESPONSIBLE DATA USE

Our approach enhances NIH resources rather than replacing them:

* Clear source citations in every interaction check
* Intelligent caching reduces API load while maintaining data currency
* Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse
* Educational focus with clear disclaimers
* Complete audit logging for accountability

RATE LIMIT JUSTIFICATION

Standard limits would severely impact real-world clinical use:

**Professional scenarios:** Emergency nurse checking 8 current medications + 2 new prescriptions = 10+ concurrent API calls, plus literature reviews across PubMed, clinical trials, and disease databases

**Public service:** Individual patients checking medication lists (5-10 drugs common), caregivers researching interactions, community health workers serving vulnerable populations

Higher limits ensure real-time responses critical for clinical decision-making.

DUAL MODEL: PUBLIC BENEFIT + SUSTAINABILITY

Our community-focused structure (DeepStudy AI, LLC) provides:

**Free Public Access:**
* Drug Interaction Checker (full features, no login)
* Direct links to authoritative NIH sources
* Comprehensive help documentation

**Professional Platform (subscription):**
* Advanced clinical decision support and workflow tools
* HIPAA-compliant patient care features
* Comprehensive research literature access

This model ensures financial sustainability while prioritizing public health access.

TRANSPARENCY OFFER

I welcome the opportunity to provide:
* Live demonstration of the public tool
* Full beta access to the professional platform
* Technical documentation of our data handling and caching
* Architecture review showing how we minimize API load
* Usage analytics (if helpful)

We view NIH data access as a partnership in service of public health. The work NIH does is invaluable, and we're committed to using these resources responsibly while serving the community.

Thank you for your consideration.

P.S. A video demonstration may be more informative than written descriptionsâ€”happy to schedule a call to show the live tool and discuss our approach.
