#### PubMed/NCBI Integration  
- **Database**: 35+ million medical literature citations
- **Rate Limits**: 3 requests/second (10/second with API key)
- **API Key**: Set `NCBI_API_KEY` in .env for enhanced limits
- **Search Fields**: Title, abstract, authors, keywords, MeSH terms

#### ClinicalTrials.gov Integration
- **Database**: Current and completed clinical studies worldwide
- **API Version**: v2 (current stable API)
- **Rate Limits**: No authentication required, reasonable use expected
- **Filters**: Condition, status, location, study type

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance async API framework with live medical data integration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# OpenAI (Required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Live Services (Optional - enables real medical data)
USE_LIVE=1  # Set to 1 to enable live APIs, 0 for development stubs

# External API Keys (Optional but recommended)
NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key  # Increases PubMed rate limits from 3/sec to 10/sec
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./app.db  # Default: SQLite, Production: PostgreSQL

# Redis (Optional - improves performance)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Falls back to in-memory cache if unavailable

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60  # Default: 60 requests per minute per IP

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]  # Frontend origins
```

### API Rate Limits & Best Practices

#### PubMed/NCBI API
- **Without API Key**: 3 requests/second, 100 requests/hour
- **With API Key**: 10 requests/second, no hourly limit  
- **Best Practice**: Register for free NCBI API key at https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/

#### MyDisease.info API
- **Rate Limits**: No authentication required, reasonable use expected
- **Best Practice**: Cache responses locally, avoid rapid successive calls

#### ClinicalTrials.gov API
- **Rate Limits**: No authentication required, reasonable use expected  
- **Best Practice**: Use specific search terms, limit result counts appropriately

#### OpenAI API
- **Rate Limits**: Varies by plan and model
- **Best Practice**: Implement exponential backoff, monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard
