- **Conditional Loading**: Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and comprehensive health checks
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 JWT-based security with API key support
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-endpoint rate limiting with Redis backend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# OpenAI (Required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Live Services (Optional - enables real medical data)
USE_LIVE=1  # Set to 1 to enable live APIs, 0 for development stubs

# External API Keys (Optional but recommended)
NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key  # Increases PubMed rate limits from 3/sec to 10/sec
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./app.db  # Default: SQLite, Production: PostgreSQL

# Redis (Optional - improves performance)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Falls back to in-memory cache if unavailable

CI / Testing note
-----------------

If Redis is not available in your test or CI environment, set the environment variable:

```bash
export AI_NURSE_DISABLE_REDIS=1
```

This forces the application to use the in-memory fallback for caching and rate limiting. The project's CI workflow runs a small healthcheck (`scripts/check_redis_health.py`) to ensure future changes do not accidentally make Redis required.

## Testing & development toggles

- AI_NURSE_DISABLE_REDIS
   - Usage: `export AI_NURSE_DISABLE_REDIS=1`
   - Effect: Forces the app to use the in-memory fallback for both the caching layer and the rate limiter. Use this in CI or local test runs when Redis is not available or when you want deterministic, fast tests.

- Async-first caching decorator (how it behaves in tests)
   - The caching decorator used across services is "async-first": it awaits cache lookups for async callables and supports sync callables as well.
   - For sync callables the decorator returns an immediate in-memory cached value (if available) and schedules a non-blocking background update to Redis to keep the remote cache warm. This background update is best-effort and intentionally non-blocking so tests and sync code don't deadlock.
   - Implication for tests: set `AI_NURSE_DISABLE_REDIS=1` to avoid timing-dependent background updates, or use the provided test utilities/monkeypatches to force synchronous cache behavior when you need to assert Redis writes.

- Quick troubleshooting
   - Tests hang on Redis calls? Set `AI_NURSE_DISABLE_REDIS=1` before running pytest.
   - Pytest complains about missing libpq / pytest-postgresql plugin locally? Either install system `libpq`/`psycopg` or run tests locally with the plugin disabled: `pytest -p no:pytest_postgresql`.

The CI job runs the healthcheck script and the test suite with Redis effectively disabled to keep the CI environment hermetic and fast.

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60  # Default: 60 requests per minute per IP

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]  # Frontend origins
```

### API Rate Limits & Best Practices

#### PubMed/NCBI API
- **Without API Key**: 3 requests/second, 100 requests/hour
- **With API Key**: 10 requests/second, no hourly limit  
- **Best Practice**: Register for free NCBI API key at https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/

#### MyDisease.info API
- **Rate Limits**: No authentication required, reasonable use expected
- **Best Practice**: Cache responses locally, avoid rapid successive calls

#### ClinicalTrials.gov API
- **Rate Limits**: No authentication required, reasonable use expected  
- **Best Practice**: Use specific search terms, limit result counts appropriately

#### OpenAI API
- **Rate Limits**: Varies by plan and model
- **Best Practice**: Implement exponential backoff, monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard
