# Railway Empty Environment - Troubleshooting

## üî¥ Issue
Railway dashboard shows production environment is empty - no services visible.

## üîç Diagnostic Questions

### 1. What do you see in Railway Dashboard?

Go to: https://railway.app

**Option A: "AI Nurse Florence" project exists but shows no services**
- This means the service was deleted or disconnected
- **Solution**: Reconnect or redeploy

**Option B: "AI Nurse Florence" project doesn't exist**
- Project was deleted
- **Solution**: Create new project and deploy

**Option C: Multiple projects visible**
- You might be looking at wrong project
- **Solution**: Switch to correct project

### 2. Is the site currently working?

Test:
```bash
curl -k https://ainurseflorence.com/api/v1/health
```

**If it returns data**: Service IS running, just not showing in dashboard
**If it fails**: Service is truly down

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Reconnect to Existing Service

If the service is running but not showing:

### Step 1: Link Railway CLI to Project
```bash
cd /Users/patrickroebuck/projects/ai-nurse-florence

# Link to project
railway link

# Select:
# - Workspace: Patrick Roebuck's Projects
# - Project: AI Nurse Florence
# - Environment: production
```

### Step 2: Check Service Status
```bash
railway status
```

Should show:
- Project name
- Environment
- Service name
- Deployment status

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Redeploy from GitHub

If service was deleted, redeploy:

### Step 1: Create New Service in Railway

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"** or open "AI Nurse Florence"
3. Click **"New Service"** ‚Üí **"GitHub Repo"**
4. Select: `silversurfer562/ai-nurse-florence`
5. Select branch: `main`
6. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 2: Railway Will Auto-Detect

Railway will automatically:
- Detect Dockerfile
- Build the container
- Deploy the service
- Assign a domain: `*.up.railway.app`

### Step 3: Add Custom Domain

After deployment:
1. Go to service **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter: `ainurseflorence.com`
4. Update DNS to point to Railway (they'll show you the records)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Deploy via Railway CLI

### Quick Deploy:
```bash
cd /Users/patrickroebuck/projects/ai-nurse-florence

# Login (if needed)
railway login

# Link to project
railway link
# Select: Patrick Roebuck's Projects ‚Üí AI Nurse Florence ‚Üí production

# Deploy
railway up

# OR deploy current code
git push railway main
```

---

## üîç Debugging: Find What Happened

### Check Railway Activity Log

1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí "AI Nurse Florence" project
2. Click **"Activity"** tab (left sidebar)
3. Look for recent events:
   - Service deleted?
   - Deployment failed?
   - Environment removed?

### Check Git History

```bash
# See recent deployments
git log --oneline -10

# Check if railway remote exists
git remote -v
```

### Check Railway Project Settings

1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí **"Settings"**
2. Look at:
   - **Services**: Should show at least 1 service
   - **Environments**: Should show "production"
   - **Variables**: Check if variables are still there

---

## üö® Emergency: Quick Redeploy

If you need to get the service running NOW:

### 1. Create New Railway Service (5 minutes)

```bash
# From project directory
cd /Users/patrickroebuck/projects/ai-nurse-florence

# Create new Railway project from scratch
railway init

# Follow prompts:
# - Create new project: "AI Nurse Florence"
# - Deploy from current directory: Yes

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 2. Set Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Set critical variables
railway variables set PORT=8000
railway variables set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

### 3. Get New Domain

```bash
# Get deployment URL
railway domain
```

This will give you a working URL immediately.

## üìã Checklist: Verify Railway Setup

After reconnecting/redeploying, verify:

- [ ] Railway Dashboard shows service in "AI Nurse Florence" project
- [ ] Service status is "Active" or "Running"
- [ ] Deployment domain is visible (*.up.railway.app)
- [ ] Environment variables are set (check Variables tab)
- [ ] Recent deployments show in Activity log
- [ ] `railway status` command shows service info
- [ ] Site is accessible: `curl https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/v1/health`

## üîß Common Causes

**Why did service disappear?**

1. **Trial period ended** - Railway free trial has limits
2. **Payment issue** - Credit card expired or payment failed
3. **Accidental deletion** - Service or project deleted
4. **Inactivity** - Railway pauses unused services
5. **Build failure** - Recent deployment failed and service crashed

---

## üí° Prevention

To avoid this in the future:

1. **Add payment method** to Railway (if not already)
2. **Enable webhook notifications** (so you know immediately if something fails)
3. **Keep local backups** of environment variables
4. **Document Railway setup** in repository
