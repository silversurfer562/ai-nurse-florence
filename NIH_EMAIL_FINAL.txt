Subject: Re: Case CAS-1531995-R8R7L5 - Public Drug Interaction Checker Live Demo

Dear NIH Support Team,

Thank you for acknowledging my data license request. I wanted to provide important context about our public health mission and demonstrate our responsible use of NIH resources.

PUBLIC SERVICE INITIATIVE: FREE DRUG INTERACTION CHECKER

Following the discontinuation of the NIH Drug Interaction API—a significant loss to the healthcare community—we have developed a comprehensive Drug Interaction Checker as part of AI Nurse Florence and deployed it as a free, publicly accessible service.

**Live Public Demo:** https://ai-nurse-florence-production.up.railway.app/public/drug-interactions
(No login required - available now for immediate evaluation)

This public tool:
* Provides free drug interaction checking to patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals
* Fills the gap left by the discontinued NIH Drug Interaction API
* Demonstrates responsible, ethical use of NIH data with full attribution
* Includes comprehensive help documentation and educational resources

RESPONSIBLE USE OF NIH RESOURCES

Our approach enhances and complements NIH resources:

**Direct Source Attribution:**
* Every interaction check includes clear citations with direct links driving users TO NIH resources
* PubMed article references, ClinicalTrials.gov connections, MedlinePlus data for patient education
* Full transparency about MyDisease.info, MyGene.info, MyChem.info data sources

**Value-Added Accessibility:**
* Synthesis of complex medical data into actionable clinical information
* 16-language support for diverse communities
* Reading level optimization for patient comprehension

**Data Governance:**
* HIPAA-compliant, session-only data handling (no PHI storage)
* Intelligent caching reduces API load while maintaining currency
* Built-in rate limiting and audit logging
* Clear educational disclaimers throughout

RATE LIMIT REQUIREMENTS - REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

Standard API limits would severely impact clinical and public use:

**Professional Use:**
* Emergency Department nurse checking 8 medications + 2 new prescriptions = 10+ concurrent API calls
* Literature reviews across PubMed, clinical trials, disease databases
* Multi-language patient education requiring multiple NIH resource lookups
* Peak clinical hours with simultaneous users

**Public Service:**
* Patients checking medication lists (5-10 drugs common)
* Caregivers researching interactions for elderly family members
* Community health workers serving vulnerable populations

Higher limits ensure real-time responses critical for clinical decision-making.

SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY SERVICE MODEL

Our company structure (DeepStudy AI, LLC with community benefit focus) balances public service with financial sustainability:

**Free Public Access:**
* Drug Interaction Checker (full features, no login)
* Help documentation and educational resources
* Direct links to authoritative NIH sources

**Professional Platform (subscription):**
* Advanced clinical decision support and workflow tools
* HIPAA-compliant patient care features
* Comprehensive research literature access

This model demonstrates how commercial entities can serve public health while remaining financially viable.

TRANSPARENCY & NEXT STEPS

I welcome the opportunity to provide:
* Live demonstration of the public Drug Interaction Checker
* Full beta access to the professional platform for NIH evaluation
* Technical documentation of data handling, caching, and attribution practices
* Architecture review showing API load minimization
* Usage analytics (if helpful)

I would be grateful to discuss our data governance framework, demonstrate the tool, and explore how we can best support NIH's public health mission.

The work NIH does to advance public health is invaluable. We are committed to using these resources in ways that honor and extend that mission while serving the community.

Thank you for your consideration and stewardship of these critical public health resources.

Best regards,

P.S. A video demonstration may be more informative than written descriptions—happy to schedule a call to show the live tool and discuss our approach.
