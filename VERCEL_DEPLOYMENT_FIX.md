# Vercel Deployment Fix - Documentation

## Problem
The AI Nurse Florence application was failing to deploy on Vercel with `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error due to Python dependency and configuration issues.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Pydantic v2 Migration Issue
**Error**: `BaseSettings` has been moved to the `pydantic-settings` package
**Fix**: 
- Added `pydantic-settings>=2.0.0` to requirements.txt
- Updated `utils/config.py` imports: `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings`
- Added default value for required `API_BEARER` setting

### 2. Celery Dependency in Serverless Environment
**Error**: Redis/Celery configuration required but not available on Vercel
**Fix**:
- Modified `celery_worker.py` to detect Vercel environment
- Made Celery imports conditional in `routers/summarize.py`
- Async endpoints only available when Celery is properly configured

### 3. Missing Dependencies
**Error**: `python-multipart` required for form data processing
**Fix**: Added `python-multipart` to requirements.txt

### 4. Application Configuration Issues
**Errors**: Missing variables and incorrect middleware configuration
**Fixes**:
- Added `EXEMPT_PATHS` definition for rate limiting
- Fixed `LoggingMiddleware` initialization (removed unsupported `logger` parameter)
- Added healthcheck router to application routing

## Vercel Configuration

Created `vercel.json` and `api/index.py` for proper serverless deployment:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "api/index.py", "use": "@vercel/python" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.py" }],
  "env": {
    "PYTHONPATH": ".",
    "API_BEARER": "vercel-default-bearer",
    "CORS_ORIGINS": "https://*.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

## Environment Detection

The application now automatically detects Vercel environment and adapts:
- Celery tasks run synchronously on Vercel (using `task_always_eager=True`)
- Redis-dependent features are disabled in serverless mode
- Core API functionality remains fully available

## Testing Results

✅ Application imports without errors
✅ FastAPI server starts successfully
✅ Health endpoint responds: `/api/v1/health`
✅ OpenAPI documentation available: `/docs`
✅ All endpoints properly configured
✅ Authentication system working
✅ Database initialization successful

## Deployment Ready

The application is now ready for Vercel deployment with:
- Proper Python 3.12 runtime configuration
- All dependencies resolved
- Serverless-compatible architecture
- Environment-specific adaptations
