## üöÄ Deployment Testing

### Step 1: Deploy & Test
```bash
# Test your Railway deployment
python scripts/test_production_endpoints.py https://your-app.railway.app

# Example output:
# ‚úÖ /health (120ms) - Main health check
# ‚úÖ /api/v1/disease/lookup?q=diabetes (450ms) - Disease lookup
# ‚úÖ /api/v1/pubmed/search?q=cancer&limit=5 (680ms) - Literature search
```

### Step 2: Monitor Performance
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
python scripts/railway_monitor.py https://your-app.railway.app --continuous

# Or single check
python scripts/railway_monitor.py https://your-app.railway.app
```

---

## üåê Live Data Verification

Test each live data source:

### 1. Disease Information (MyDisease.info)
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/disease/lookup?q=diabetes"
# Expected: Disease definition, symptoms, treatments
```

### 2. Medical Literature (PubMed)
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/pubmed/search?q=hypertension&limit=3"
# Expected: Recent medical articles with abstracts
```

### 3. Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov)
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/trials/search?condition=cancer&limit=2"
# Expected: Active clinical trials
```

### 4. Patient Education (MedlinePlus)
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/medlineplus/summary?topic=diabetes"
# Expected: Patient-friendly health information
```

---

## ü§ñ AI Features Testing

If OpenAI key is configured:

### Patient Education Generation
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/education/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "diabetes management", "reading_level": "elementary"}'
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "topic": "diabetes management",
    "content": "Understanding Diabetes Management...",
    "reading_level": "elementary",
    "banner": "Draft for clinician review ‚Äî not medical advice"
  }
}
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Your Railway deployment should achieve:

| Metric | Target | Excellent |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Health Check** | < 1 second | < 500ms |
| **Disease Lookup** | < 3 seconds | < 1 second |
| **Literature Search** | < 5 seconds | < 2 seconds |
| **AI Generation** | < 10 seconds | < 5 seconds |
| **Uptime** | > 99.5% | > 99.9% |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Production Tools

### 1. Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check application status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Readiness probe
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/ready

# Liveness probe
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/live
```

### 2. API Documentation
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`
- Interactive API testing
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples

### 3. Monitoring Scripts
```bash
# Comprehensive endpoint testing
./scripts/test_production_endpoints.py

# Continuous monitoring with alerts
./scripts/railway_monitor.py --continuous

# Local development testing
./deploy.sh test
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: 503 Service Unavailable
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

### Issue: Slow API Responses
**Solution:**
1. Check Redis cache status in health endpoint
2. Verify external API connectivity
3. Monitor response times with monitoring script

### Issue: External API Errors
**Solutions:**
- **PubMed errors**: Check NCBI service status
- **Disease API errors**: Verify MyDisease.info availability
- **OpenAI errors**: Check API key and billing status
